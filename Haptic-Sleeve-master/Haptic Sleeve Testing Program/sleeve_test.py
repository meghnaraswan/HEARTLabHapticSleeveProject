# Haptic Sleeve Testing Program
# By Grant Stankaitis
#
# Summary:
# This program is used to test the Haptic Sleeve.
# Commands are sent programmatically to test various scenarios.
# Everything is logged, so check the log file for analysis.
# When test cases are running, select ONLY numerical or alphabetical keys (NO arrow keys, enter, etc.).
# This is due to msvcrt.getche()- Reads a keypress, returns the resulting character; does not wait for Enter press.
#
# The 3 testing scenarios are:
# Accuracy, being able to correctly decipher the correct direction
# Speed, how quick the user can react to haptic feedback
# Intensity, can the user distinguish between different vibrational intensities?
#
# Directions:
# Accuracy: Press W-A-S-D keys for directions, NOT arrow keys
# W- Forward, A- Left, S- Back, D- Right
# Speed: User can pick any key to press, select ONLY numerical or alphabetical keys
# Intensity: User can select 1, 2, 3 to pick intensity level
